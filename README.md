I built a multi-user web application that allows the logged in user to create and maintain a list of his contacts.  The app sends an email to the user when there is a contact with an upcoming birthday.  App automatically sends emails X hours before the birthday where X is configurable by the user.

I used Java 7, Netbeans IDE 12.3 and Play 1.2.4 for this assesment.

Setup:
1- Run "play run scaleGridOA" in command line. (Assuming play framework is already in path)
2- Go to a browser and type "http://localhost:9000" and enter.
